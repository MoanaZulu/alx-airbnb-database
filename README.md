## SQL joins
This task demonstrates mastery of SQL joins:

- **INNER JOIN**: Connects `bookings` to `users` to show who made each booking.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Connects `properties` to `reviews`, including properties without reviews.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Lists all `users` and all `bookings`, even if they aren't linked.

All queries are tested and optimized for clarity and correctness.
